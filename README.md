# Large-scale whole-exome sequencing analyses identified protein-coding variants associated with metabolism-related chronic diseases

Cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome (CKM) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are distinct but prevalent chronic conditions with complex genetic architectures. Using large-scale whole-exome sequencing data from the UK Biobank, we performed systematic analyses to identify protein-coding variants associated with these disorders. For CKM, we focused on uncovering shared genetic factors that link cardiovascular, kidney, and metabolic traits. For IBS, we further investigated genetic correlations with psychiatric disorders, aiming to reveal the biological pathways that connect gut-brain axis. Together, these studies provide new insights into the genetic basis of metabolism-related and gut-brain disorders, with implications for precision medicine.
